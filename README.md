## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+**
- **pnpm** (install with `npm install -g pnpm`)
- **For HTTPS development**: Caddy (install with `brew install caddy`)
- **TypeScript 5+** for enhanced type safety

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

### Standard HTTP Development
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
pnpm run dev

# Start frontend only (port 5173)
pnpm run dev:frontend

# Start backend API only (port 3000)
pnpm run dev:server
```

### HTTPS Development (Recommended)
For production-like testing with automatic SSL certificates:

```bash
# Install Caddy (one-time setup)
brew install caddy

# Start with HTTPS
pnpm run dev:https
```

**Access your application:**
- 🌐 Frontend: https://app.localhost
- 🔌 Backend API: https://api.localhost

**First-time setup:** Your browser will warn about self-signed certificates. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to site" to continue.

### Docker Development

For containerized development with PostgreSQL and Redis:

```bash
# Start development containers
cd docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Or run in background
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Stop containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

**Access your application:**
- 🌐 Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- 🔌 Backend API: http://localhost:3000
- 🗃️ PostgreSQL: localhost:5434
- 📊 Redis: localhost:6381

See [Docker documentation](docker/DOCKER.md) for full setup details and production deployment.

### Testing & Quality Assurance
```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test

# Run tests once (for CI/scripts)
pnpm test:run

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Run tests with UI
pnpm test:ui

# Type check without building
pnpm typecheck

# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Lint and fix issues
pnpm lint:fix
```

### Development Testing with URL Parameters

The application includes powerful development testing features using URL parameters:

#### DevStep Parameter
Jump directly to any onboarding step with pre-populated mock data:

```bash
# Jump to step 2 (Customer Info) with mock data
http://localhost:5173/?devStep=2

# Jump to step 3 (Identification) with mock data
http://localhost:5173/?devStep=3

# Available steps: 1-5 (Product Selection → Confirmation)
```

#### Mock Scenarios
Test different customer scenarios by combining `devStep` with `mockScenario`:

```bash
# Test international customer (no SSN)
http://localhost:5173/?devStep=3&mockScenario=noSSN

# Test customer with passport
http://localhost:5173/?devStep=3&mockScenario=passport

# Test different billing address
http://localhost:5173/?devStep=2&mockScenario=differentBilling

# Test money market account selection
http://localhost:5173/?devStep=1&mockScenario=moneyMarket
```

**Available Mock Scenarios:**
- `driversLicense` - Standard driver's license verification
- `passport` - Passport-based identification
- `stateId` - State ID verification
- `militaryId` - Military ID verification
- `noSSN` - International customer without SSN
- `differentBilling` - Customer with different billing address
- `moneyMarket` - Money market account selection
- `savingsOnly` - Savings account only

#### Development Helper UI
When using `devStep`, a floating development panel appears showing:
- Current step and scenario
- Quick navigation between steps (1-5)
- Scenario switcher for testing different customer types
- Real-time URL parameter updates

### Production Build
```bash
# Build frontend
pnpm run build

# Build backend
pnpm run build:server

# Preview built frontend
pnpm run preview
```

## Docker Deployment

For containerized deployment with PostgreSQL, Redis, and HTTPS:

```bash
# Navigate to docker directory
cd docker

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d
```

See [Docker documentation](docker/DOCKER.md) for detailed setup instructions.
